    Designed and implemented algorithms to assess and classify tremor severity in patients with late-stage Parkinson's Disease.
            
                \item 
    Created a highly scalable and extensible web application to be used by the researchers in the lab during this project. This web application incorporated HIPAA-compliant data storage and access, as well as efficient cluster management with Docker and Kubernetes.
            
                \item 
    Provided input to hardware research based on statistical tremor analysis results, with the goal of designing a complete low-cost system for tremor analysis. Contributed to additive manufacturing models and designing sensor arrays for a data collection glove to be used for the tremor analysis project.
            
                \item 
    Performed cost comparisons to identify the most economical Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) provider, given the storage, computation, and cost constraints of the project.

                \item 
    Led the design and development of the PaperRank Framework, a methodology for deriving probabilistic community trust in academic publications. PaperRank utilized the PageRank algorithm, coupled with a Gamma Mixture Model applied to citation networks of academic publications. A proof-of-concept was implemented, from extraction to final trust score computation, analyzing over 14 Million articles from the NCBI PubMed Database.
            
                \item 
    Formulated and implemented novel strategies for semantically-enhanced automated extraction of medical directives from Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs), for eventual inclusion in a knowledge graph of Diabetes diagnosis and treatment directives. Built the 'Guideline Explorer', a tool for efficiently visualizing and examining the American Diabetes Association's 2018 CPGs.
            
                \item 
    Explored the field of 'Semantalytics', which lies at the intersection of Semantics and Analytics. Drafted a Vision statement for the future exploration of this novel field of research, through the lens of bioinformatics.
            
                \item 
    Formulated an Electronic Health Record (EHR) simulation engine, which utilized Monte Carlo simulations based on a generalized population heuristic to vary idiosyncratic patient attributes. The EHR Simulation engine would suggest medical tests that would be statistically likely to identify previously unknown medical issues.
            
                \item 
    Developed the 'Guideline Analysis Framework', a mathematical formulation of CPGs. This framework was designed to enable the comparison of various CPGs from differing medical authorities addressing the same set of diseases, and to detect disparities in treatment directives.

    Represented the University of Washington at the inaugural SpaceX Hyperloop Pod Competition in Hawthorne, CA. We placed 4th in the United States, and 6th globally; the competition initially received 1,700 team proposals, which were narrowed down to 30 finalists.
            
                \item 
    Led the Business Management Team to launch a highly successful crowdfunding campaign, raising over \$20,000 in cash (with an initial goal of \$10,000), and over \$80,000 of source materials used in the construction of the Pod.

                \item 
    We introduce the PaperRank scoring algorithm; a proxy of scientific community trust in a given publication. This score is derived from the classic PageRank algorithm (applied to academic citation networks), in conjunction with a one-dimensional Gamma Mixture Model to normalize the PageRank scores on a 3-group publication notoriety heuristic.
            
                \item 
    The key contributions of this publication are the PaperRank Framework (currently configured for use with the NCBI PubMed Database), and a generalized algorithm for optimizing a Gamma Mixture Model (GMM).
            
                \item 
    A key application of PaperRank would be to underwrite provenance-enabled Knowledge Graphs (where assertions are justified by academic publication references) with a 'trust' heuristic, to enable quasi-probabilistic behavior during inference and traversal.

    This work attempts to synthesize a clear and unambiguous definition of a 'Knowledge Graph' that conforms to current knowledge graph research, while constraining the research space that may be considered a knowledge graph.
            
                \item 
    We evaluate a wide variety of knowledge resources, graphs, and other ontologies to determine if they qualify under our definition, and built a 'Knowledge Graph Catalog' to support this effort.

    This research addresses a key challenge faced by physicians using Clinical Practice Guideline recommendations; determining how well idiosyncratic cohort evidence generalizes to the greater clinical population.
            
                \item 
    The end goal of this system is to enable the parsing of publications broadly identified as research studies to extract cohort variables and exposure/intervention groups defined within the structured population descriptions to better inform treatment decisions.
